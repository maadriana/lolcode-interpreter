# Project Progress Log â€“ LOLCODE Interpreter

This file contains our weekly progress summaries and deliverable status for the LOLCODE interpreter project.

---

## Week 1: Research & Design

**Objectives:**
- Understand LOLCODE syntax, features, and challenges
- Study interpreter architecture (Lexer, Parser, Evaluator)
- Design the interpreter structure and flow
- Set up GitHub repository and team commits

**Deliverables Completed:**
- GitHub repo created with `.gitignore` and `team.txt`
- Each member contributed a 1-page LOLCODE research file
- Uploaded interpreter design diagram (flowchart)
- Created `week1/` folder with all research assets

**Status:** Completed

## Week 2: MVP Implementation

**Objectives:**
- Implement core interpreter components: Lexer, Parser, Evaluator
- Support basic LOLCODE syntax (variables, I/O, arithmetic, conditionals)
- Run and debug `.lol` test files
- Collaborate using Git branches and commits

**Deliverables Completed:**
- Working MVP interpreter in Python with:
  - `main.py`, `lexer.py`, `parser.py`, `interpreter.py`
- Two `.lol` test files:
  - `hello_world.lol`
  - `conditional.lol`
- Logic verified via test runs
- Git repo updated with all source and test files in `week2-3/`

**Challenges Faced:**
- Parser required exact structure for `O RLY?` blocks
- `VISIBLE` and `IT` printing logic was tricky without `SMOOSH`
- Ensured correct variable state tracking and truthy evaluation

**Wins:**
- Tests run successfully without syntax errors
- Clean folder structure and clear code separation by module
- Team collaborated smoothly using GitHub

**Next Steps:**
- Add boolean operations (`BOTH OF`, `DIFFRINT`)
- Explore loop support (`IM IN YR`)
- Begin unit testing and edge case validation

**Status:** Completed

## Week 3: Finalization & Enhancements

**Objectives:**
- Finalize the interpreter with complete LOLCODE feature support
- Add bonus features: `SMOOSH`, `WIN`/`FAIL`, nested expressions
- Build GUI runner for loading and running `.lol` files
- Add unit tests and edge case validation
- Polish documentation and folder structure

**Deliverables Completed:**
- Added advanced features:
  - `SMOOSH`, nested expressions, TROOF checks, line-number errors
- Created GUI app (`gui_runner.py`) using Tkinter
- Added `test/final_test.lol` covering all features
- Implemented `unittest` suite for interpreter behavior
- Finalized `README.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and reflection content

**Challenges Faced:**
- SMOOSH and multiple AN parsing was interpreter-sensitive
- GUI integration with input/output required flushing fixes
- Ensuring backward compatibility with earlier test files

**Wins:**
- All `.lol` test files pass successfully
- GUI and CLI both fully functional
- Interpreter structure is modular and robust
- All bonus features completed for extra credit

**Status:** Completed
